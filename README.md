# 42-pool

I spent a whole month in 1337 coding school; learnt much about programming, peer learning and time managing! 
During the whole period, I got the chance to get 5.6 in level and to validate 2 out of 4 exams :)
It was a very fun month, I had a great time coding and discovering new things and new people :D
